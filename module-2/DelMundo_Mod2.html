        <h2>Chapter 1: Celine Del Mundo</h2>
        <p class = "intro">Hello, my name is Celine Del Mundo. I was born in the Philippines, but now reside in Seattle, WA. I am 25 years old.</p>
        <p>I love to eat food. My favorite food to eat is Thai food, specifically Pad See Ew. My favorite food to cook is Spaghetti, Filipino style.</p>
        <p>I currently have three dogs and two angel dogs. My favorite breed of dogs are the Pekingese. They're loyal, great companions, and amazing fuzz balls.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursing a software development degree. My aim is to work in the tech field after leaving my current employer. I would ideally like to work in the gaming niche.</p>
