            <p>I am a professional mechanic in the largest used car dealership in the country. Nothing gets me going through the day unless I can finish my workload. I constantly strive for the best everyday and this is where I start. I took a picture of this for the shear reason that I felt cool. Being a mechanic is always something special to me as I continue to know more and more about them. There is never an easy car since each different car has their own personality and characteristics.</p>

            <p>A perfect day for me is o	Cruising down to the beach and watching the sunrise. Eventually just walking around the beach with my girlfriend and just talk for hours. Maybe bring my dogs as well. Outside of work, I’m a pretty chill fella, I happen to just want to work on my car all day. Pushing it to it’s limits, if it’s not working on cars, I’d take my car out for a ride and just drive where ever it takes me. –It’s usually to my girlfriend.</p>

        <p>I am a tinker, I want to make things work better and smoother. It doesn’t have to be about cars. It could be computers, bed, bikes. As long as I can increase my comfortability and convienence, I am all up for it. This is me comparing an old alternator to a new one. For those who don't know what an alternator is, an alternator is an electrical generator that converts mechanical energy to electrical in a form of alternating current.</p>
