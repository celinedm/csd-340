        <h2>Chapter 1: Celine Del Mundo</h2>
        <p class = "intro">Hello, my name is Celine Del Mundo. I was born in the Philippines, but now reside in Seattle, WA. I am 25 years old. I moved to the United States when I was just four years old. It was easier for me to grasp the English language since I was so young. I would only speak Tagalog, one of Philippines dialect, at home and English at school. Eventually it caused a lot of trouble due to me having to write a letter to my grandparents for an assignment. Unable to grade my work, my teachers started to put me in an ESL class thinking I did not know how to speak perfect English. It was squashed as soon as I took the test because I aced every word. </p>
        <p>I love to eat food. My favorite food to eat is Thai food, specifically Pad See Ew. My favorite food to cook is Spaghetti, Filipino style. The main difference between traditional Italian spaghetti and Filipino Spaghetti is the taste. The Italian method is made from tomatoes while the Filipino way is made from a special sauce called Banana Ketchup. Banana ketchup is made from bananas, sweeter than it's fruit counterpart. Banana ketchup was made during World War II, the Philippines had a hard time finding tomatoes to make regular ketchup. Thus the banana ketchup was born in 1942. </p>
        <p>I currently have three dogs and two angel dogs. My favorite breed of dogs are the Pekingese. They're loyal, great companions, and amazing fuzz balls. Currently my two dogs, Appa and Momo, reside with my boyfriend as I felt the need to take a break on having many dogs in my house after my two family dogs passed away. They entered my life when I was 12 / 13 years old respectively that I never thought that I would out live them. They lived a long life, althought I needed time for myself to just feel the lost after the most recent one late 2023.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursing a software development degree. My aim is to work in the tech field after leaving my current employer. I would ideally like to work in the gaming niche. I have always been a fan of the gaming industry. Since I was little I recall playing on the Nintendo NES back in my grandparents house in Las Vegas. I constantly wanted to be the best and tried to beat the game 100%. Once I got into the work field, I fell in love with the operations side of companies. I currently work for a big retailer as their operations manager as well as having 6 years of operations prior to this work place. I like the behind the scene work and seeing how things function.</p>
