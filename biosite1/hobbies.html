            <p>I was born in Tedim, Burma. Although I moved to the United States in 2012. Just before freshman year in high school. Being born in Burma and moving here, I just want to be able to obtain all the possibilities that presented to me. Work at it 110% and abiding life doing the right things. I don’t need much, but I just want to striving for a better life than I had.</p>

            <p>Exploring Seattle was a memory I wouldn't forget. This was my first time at the Aquarium and I felt so intrgued with all different marine life. Eventually I'd like to explore of Seattle, I think you can tell I'm a little bit of a work-a-holic. I've learned that Seattle is great for food. My favorite food is Oriental food, I really like Asian food, but I think that’s just cause I am Asian. Although I am willing to explore any type of dishes as long as it’s sweet. I have a sweet tooth and while savory and spice can be appealing some times, I prefer a lot of tang and sweetness.</p>

            <p>This is my prized car. My dream car is a Subaru WRX, but since I’ve obtained it earlier in my life time. So I’ve set my eyes on a Nissan R32 Skyline. This car holds something dear to me as it was something that I worked hard for. I saved every each of penny to ensure that I earned a car like this. With it's sweet tunes coming out from the exhaust, I feel at one with my dream car. Due to some harsh weathers, he unfortunately needed sometime to get fixing. I'm fixing my car currently. I can't wait to get back on the road!</p>
